I had a sign at work I needed to display and I didn't have a good wall space to hang it, so I designed this. 

When I printed it, the tolerances were a little loose. I used one wrap of electrical tape and it was perfect.

I designed it to print with no supports; the Plackard Top and Bottom print upside down and you may need a brim. I printed mine in PLA with 3 walls, 5 tops, 4 bottoms, and 15% cross hatch infill. It used about 346g of fillament.
