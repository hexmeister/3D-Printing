Filament Spool Holder

I wanted a filament spool holder I could sit on top of my voron 2.4 and mount to the top back 2020 rail, so I designed this one.

It requires two M3x8 screws and two M3 T-nuts to mount it, and a short piece of 4mm (outer diameter) PTFE for the spool to glide on. The hole for the Reverse-Bowden tube wasn't quite tight enough to hold the tube in place well on my print, so I wrapped some electrical tape on it on both sides to make it stay put.
