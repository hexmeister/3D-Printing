I recreated Vincent Chan's excellent hex driver in FreeCad to make it magnetic. I recreated the handle model in FreeCad to remove the latch mechanism (which didn't work well for me) and to add a recess for a 6x2mm magnet.

I also recreated the stand in FreeCad to add more bits and I modified the handle holes. My model didn't quite fit the original and I just made them round so I don't have to orient the handle with the hole.

The originals can be found here: ![Hex Driver and Stand](https://www.printables.com/model/21710-hex-bit-driver-stand-with-latch)

It works great. I printed this in PLA on a budget Longer LK5 Pro, then I bought a set of ball head hex allen drill bits and a set of regular hex allen drill bits, and this is what I used to build my Voron 2.4r2 pinter. I printed like 4 different color handles to hold the most used bits and I use this a system a lot!

I believe I printed the handles with 5 walls and 25% infill, and the holder with 3 walls and 15 or 20% infill.
